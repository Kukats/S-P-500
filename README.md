S&P 500 Stock Analysis and Forecasting

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes S&P 500 stock trends to identify investment opportunities and economic signals. We apply time series forecasting models to predict stock prices and evaluate model performance.

📊 Data Sources

S&P 500 historical data sourced from Yahoo Finance / Kaggle
Data includes Open, High, Low, Close prices, trading volume, and market trends.
📈 Methodology

We implemented and compared various forecasting models:

Linear Regression
Naïve Algorithm
Exponential Smoothing (ETS - MAA: Multiplicative Error, Additive Trend, Additive Seasonality)
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
After evaluation, Exponential Smoothing (ETS - MAA) proved most effective for forecasting S&P 500 stock prices in our dataset.

🔍 Key Findings

The S&P 500 exhibits seasonal trends and economic cyclicality.
ETS (MAA) provided the most reliable short-term forecasts.
Market dynamics change rapidly, so regular model updates are essential.
🛠️ Technologies Used

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Forecasting Models: ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Regression
